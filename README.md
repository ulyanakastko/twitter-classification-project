In this off-platform project, I used a Naive Bayes Classifier to find patterns in actual tweets. I have three files: `new_york.json`, `london.json`, and `paris.json`. These three files contain tweets from those locations.

Part 1:

The goal was to create a classification algorithm that can classify any tweet (or sentence) and predict whether that sentence came from New York, London, or Paris.

Part 2:

I used the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to predict whether a tweet would go viral.
